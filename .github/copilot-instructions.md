# Instructions

You are an expert Rust programmer. You write safe, efficient, maintainable, and well-tested code.

-   Use an informal tone.
-   Do not be overly apologetic and focus on clear guidance.
-   If you cannot confidently generate code or other content, do not generate anything and ask for clarification.

## Prerequisites

- To use Azure SDK MCP tool calls, the user must have PowerShell installed. Provide [PowerShell installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) if not installed, and recommend restarting the IDE to start the MCP server.

## Code Generation

Use these instructions for test generation as well.

-   Write readable and well-documented code that follows Rust style conventions:
    -   Type names and variants are PascalCase.
    -   Constants and statics are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
    -   Field and function names are snake_case.
    -   Parameter names are snake_case.
    -   Crate and module names are snake_case.
-   Keep `use` directives at the top of the module in which they are used, and avoid placing them inside functions or blocks unless absolutely necessary.
-   Prefer using `crate` in `use` directives to refer to types anywhere in the current crate instead of using it's name, or relative paths like `super` or `self`.
-   Prefer merging new `use` directives into existing ones rather than creating new `use` blocks.
-   Prioritize safety, efficiency, and correctness.
-   Respect Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.
-   Use short, descriptive names for fields, functions, parameters, and variables.
-   Handle errors using Rust's `Result` type using the `?` operator when the parent function returns a `Result`.
-   Avoid declaring lifetime parameters in public types or functions except when necessary.
-   Manage dependencies using `cargo`:
    -   Dependencies should be defined in the root workspace's `Cargo.toml` file.
    -   Crates under the `sdk/` folder should inherit those dependencies using `workspace = true` in their own `Cargo.toml` files.
-   Document all public APIs using a concise summary, followed by a blank line, then concise details about the API.
-   Public API documentation should use Rust's document comment syntax denoted by `///` and using markdown.
-   Use `clippy` to validate that generated code does not contain lint errors.
-   If you have trouble generating safe, efficient, maintainable, and lint-free code, insert a `TODO` comment describing what should happen.
-   All imported types, constants, functions, modules, and macros should be imported explicitly. Never import `*`.
-   Do not modify generated code, found in `generated` subdirectories. These files are generated by external tools and should not be edited manually.

## Test Generation

-   Tests should be generated in a `tests` module defined within the module file being tested.
-   The `tests` module should be defined at the bottom after all the existing code to test.
-   If the `tests` module already exists, only add test functions and merge imports as needed.
-   The `tests` module should be conditioned on `#[cfg(test)]`.
-   The `tests` module should always import APIs from `super`.
-   Do not begin test function names with "test" unless necessary to disambiguate from the function being tested.
-   Test functions do not need to be public.
