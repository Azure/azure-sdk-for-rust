# Cosmos SDK Instructions

- CONSIDER all instructions in the sdk/cosmos/AGENTS.md file and the sdk/cosmos/.github/instructions folder when making changes to any files in the sdk/cosmos folder or its subfolders in addition to those in the AGENTS.md file and the .github/instructions folder.
- PREFER the Cosmos specific instructions in the sdk/cosmos/AGENTS.md file or the sdk/cosmos/.github/instructions folder over the general instructions in the .github/instructions folder if there are any conflicts.
