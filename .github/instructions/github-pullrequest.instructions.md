# Instructions for GitHub Pull Requests

-   GitHub Pull Requests should follow the standard form for Git commits:

    ```markdown
    title of no more than 50 characters

    multi-line descriptions
    ```

-   Summarize changes for a title of no more than 50 characters ideally, with a hard stop at 80 characters.
-   Descriptions can be multiple lines or even paragraphs using markdown.
-   Descriptions may contain markdown.
-   Descriptions should not repeat a lot of content already found in the changed files.
-   Summarize changes for each file if no more than 10 files are changed.
-   If multiple files contain the same changes, group them together when summarizing changes.
-   Try to reason why changes were made and not about what was changed.
-   If any added comments in changed files reference fixing an issue like "Fixes #1234" include that same text in the description.
-   If multiple issues are fixed or resolved, include that same text separately for each issue like "Fixes #1234 and fixes #5678".
