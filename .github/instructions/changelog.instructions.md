-   Summarize each change to public APIs in a single line for clarity and brevity.
-   If there are no changes to public APIs, do not make any changes to `CHANGELOG.md` files.
-   Place each change under the appropriate existing category header (e.g., "Features Added", "Breaking Changes", "Bugs Fixed", "Other Changes", etc.) found under the top-level `##` section.
-   Do not create new category headers; use only those already present in the file.
-   Ensure all entries are concise, accurate, and relevant to the release.
-   Follow the existing formatting and style conventions of the file.
