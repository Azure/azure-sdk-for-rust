# Azure Service Bus client library for Rust

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. Service Bus is used to decouple applications and services from each other, providing the following benefits:

-   Load-balancing work across competing workers
-   Safely routing and transferring data and control across service and application boundaries
-   Coordinating transactional work that requires a high-degree of reliability

## WARNING - Not production ready crate

This crate is in early development, it **SHOULD NOT** be used in production.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

-   An [Azure subscription].
-   The [Azure CLI] can also be useful for authenticating in a development environment, creating accounts, and managing account roles.

### Install dependencies

Add the following crates to your project:

```sh
cargo add azure_identity
```

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Azure Service Bus service, you'll need to create an instance of a client class. To create a client object, you'll need the Service Bus namespace and a credential object.

#### Using Azure Identity

```rust,no_run
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use azure_messaging_servicebus::ServiceBusClient;
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;

let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;
let client = ServiceBusClient::builder()
    .open("your_namespace.servicebus.windows.net", credential.clone())
    .await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

The `ServiceBusClient` supports all credential types from the `azure_identity` crate:

-   **DeveloperToolsCredential** (Recommended for development): Automatically tries multiple authentication methods
-   **ManagedIdentityCredential** (Recommended for production): For Azure resources with managed identity

All credentials handle token acquisition, caching, and refresh.

For a comprehensive example showing all credential types, see [token_credential_auth.rs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/blob/main/sdk/servicebus/azure_messaging_servicebus/examples/token_credential_auth.rs).

## Key concepts

-   **Namespace**: A Service Bus namespace is a scoping container for all messaging components.
-   **Queue**: A queue allows storage of messages until the receiving application is available to receive and process them.
-   **Topic**: A topic provides a one-to-many form of communication using a publish/subscribe pattern.
-   **Subscription**: A subscription is used to receive messages from a topic.
-   **Message**: A message is a package of information that contains both data and metadata.

## Examples

### Samples

See our [samples]

### Send a message to a queue

```rust,no_run
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use azure_messaging_servicebus::{ServiceBusClient, Message, CreateSenderOptions, SendMessageOptions};
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;

let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;
let client = ServiceBusClient::builder()
    .open("your_namespace.servicebus.windows.net", credential.clone())
    .await?;
let sender = client.create_sender("my_queue", None).await?;

let message = Message::from("Hello, Service Bus!");
sender.send_message(message, None).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

### Receive messages from a queue

```rust,no_run
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use azure_messaging_servicebus::{ServiceBusClient, CreateReceiverOptions, ReceiveMessageOptions, CompleteMessageOptions};
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;

let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;
let client = ServiceBusClient::builder()
    .open("your_namespace.servicebus.windows.net", credential.clone())
    .await?;
let receiver = client.create_receiver("my_queue", None).await?;

let messages = receiver.receive_messages(5, None).await?;
for message in messages {
    println!("Received: {}", message.body_as_string()?);
    receiver.complete_message(&message, None).await?;
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

### Send a message to a topic

```rust,no_run
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use azure_messaging_servicebus::{ServiceBusClient, Message, CreateSenderOptions, SendMessageOptions};
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;

let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;
let client = ServiceBusClient::builder()
    .open("your_namespace.servicebus.windows.net", credential.clone())
    .await?;
let sender = client.create_sender("my_topic", None).await?;

let message = Message::from("Hello, Topic subscribers!");
sender.send_message(message, None).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

### Receive messages from a subscription

```rust,no_run
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use azure_messaging_servicebus::{ServiceBusClient, CreateReceiverOptions, ReceiveMessageOptions, CompleteMessageOptions};
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;

let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;
let client = ServiceBusClient::builder()
    .open("your_namespace.servicebus.windows.net", credential.clone())
    .await?;
let receiver = client.create_receiver_for_subscription("my_topic", "my_subscription", None).await?;

let messages = receiver.receive_messages(5, None).await?;
for message in messages {
    println!("Received: {}", message.body_as_string()?);
    receiver.complete_message(&message, None).await?;
}
# Ok(())
# }
```
