### Related Specs

- [`TRANSPORT_PIPELINE_SPEC.md`](./TRANSPORT_PIPELINE_SPEC.md) — sharded HTTP/2 transport, timeout regime, hedging, `(HttpClient, host:port)` shard key. Gateway 2.0 reuses the sharded transport defined there verbatim; this spec does **not** introduce a new timeout or hedging policy.
- [`PARTITION_KEY_RANGE_CACHE_SPEC.md`](./PARTITION_KEY_RANGE_CACHE_SPEC.md) — PKRange cache semantics and `EffectivePartitionKey` usage; cited by Phase 2 for EPK computation and by Phase 4 for 410 handling.
- [`PARTITION_LEVEL_FAILOVER_SPEC.md`](./PARTITION_LEVEL_FAILOVER_SPEC.md) — per-partition region override semantics; cited by Phase 4 for PLF precedence over Gateway 2.0 routing.

## 1. Overview

Gateway 2.0 (formerly "thin client") is a server-side proxy that allows SDK clients to route data-plane operations through a lightweight proxy endpoint instead of directly to backend replicas. It uses RNTBD binary protocol over HTTP/2, with the proxy handling partition routing, replica selection, and load balancing.

**Naming**: Use "Gateway 2.0" consistently in all Rust code, docs, and comments. Avoid "thin client" except when referencing Java/.NET code or existing constants (`THINCLIENT_*`).

---

## 2. Motivation

### Why Gateway 2.0?

Traditional Cosmos DB offers two connection modes:

- **Gateway mode**: Simple HTTP/REST proxy — easy to use, but adds an extra network hop through a shared stateless gateway. No latency SLA guarantees because the gateway is a shared, best-effort proxy.
- **Direct mode**: SDK connects directly to backend replicas via TCP/RNTBD — provides latency SLA guarantees but requires the SDK to manage replica discovery, connection pooling, and partition routing itself. This adds significant complexity to the SDK and requires direct network access to backend nodes.

**Gateway 2.0 bridges this gap.** It is a gateway mode with SLA latency guarantees — combining the operational simplicity of gateway mode (single endpoint, no direct backend connectivity required, firewall-friendly) with the performance characteristics of direct mode (RNTBD binary protocol, server-side partition routing, replica-aware load balancing).

### Key Benefits

- **SLA latency guarantees** — Unlike traditional gateway, Gateway 2.0 provides contractual latency commitments comparable to direct mode
- **Simplified networking** — Clients connect to a single regional proxy endpoint over HTTPS; no need to open firewall rules to individual backend replicas
- **Reduced SDK complexity** — The proxy handles replica discovery, connection management, and partition-level routing; the SDK only needs RNTBD serialization and endpoint selection
- **HTTP/2 multiplexing** — Multiple concurrent operations share a single TCP connection, reducing connection overhead vs. direct mode's per-replica TCP connections
- **Transparent failover** — The proxy handles replica failover within a partition; the SDK handles regional failover across proxy endpoints

### Design Philosophy

Gateway 2.0 moves partition-level routing intelligence from the SDK into the server-side proxy while keeping regional routing in the SDK. This gives the best of both worlds:

**SDK Responsibility:**

- Regional endpoint selection
- RNTBD serialization
- EPK header injection

**Gateway 2.0 Proxy (Server-Side):**

- Partition routing
- Replica selection
- Load balancing

### Connection Mode Comparison

| Aspect | Gateway | Gateway 2.0 | Direct |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latency SLA | No | **Yes** | Yes |
| Simple Network | Yes | Yes | No |
| Protocol | HTTP/REST | RNTBD/HTTP2 | RNTBD/TCP |
| Replica Mgmt | Proxy | Proxy | SDK |
| Partition Route | Proxy | Proxy | SDK |
| Regional Route | SDK | SDK | SDK |
| SDK Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Firewall Rules | 1 endpoint | 1 endpoint | N replicas |

## 3. Current Rust State

The Rust driver (`azure_data_cosmos_driver`) already has significant gateway 2.0 scaffolding.

### 3.1 Already Implemented — endpoint & transport

- **`CosmosEndpoint`** — `gateway20_url: Option<Url>` field, `regional_with_gateway20()`, `uses_gateway20()`, `selected_url()` methods
- **`TransportMode::Gateway20`** enum variant in pipeline components
- **`RoutingDecision`** — carries `transport_mode` that distinguishes gateway vs gateway 2.0
- **`ConnectionPoolOptions`** — `is_gateway20_allowed: bool` config (see §3.4 for gating model)
- **`CosmosTransport`** — `dataplane_gateway20_transport: OnceLock<AdaptiveTransport>`, lazy init with `AdaptiveTransport::gateway20()`
- **`AdaptiveTransport::ShardedGateway20`** variant — always HTTP/2 with prior knowledge
- **`HttpClientConfig::dataplane_gateway20()`** — HTTP/2-only config (see Open Question Q1 about prior-knowledge vs ALPN)
- **`TransportKind::Gateway20`** in diagnostics

### 3.2 Already Implemented — account metadata & routing

- **`LocationStateStore`** — `gateway20_enabled` flag, passes through to endpoint construction
- **`AccountProperties::has_thin_client_endpoints()`** (`account_metadata_cache.rs:191`) — detection helper
- **`AccountProperties::thin_client_writable_regions()` / `thin_client_readable_regions()`** (`account_metadata_cache.rs:197,205`) — region accessors
- **`parse_thin_client_locations()`** — parser for `thinClient(Readable|Writable)Locations`
- **`build_account_endpoint_state()`** (`routing_systems.rs`) — resolves gateway 2.0 URLs from account properties
- **Existing tests** in `routing_systems.rs:218–289` already exercise GW20 endpoint construction with both readable and writable thin-client locations
- **`resolve_endpoint()`** in operation pipeline — selects gateway 2.0 URL when `prefer_gateway20` is true (see §3.4)

### 3.3 Already Implemented — EPK & constants

- **`EffectivePartitionKey::compute()` / `::compute_range()`** — in `azure_data_cosmos_driver::models::effective_partition_key` (MultiHash-aware, hierarchical-PK correct). This is the canonical path and is what Gateway 2.0 header injection MUST call. Both functions return `azure_core::Result` (per PR #4087 review: MultiHash-requires-V2 and component-count checks are runtime errors, not `debug_assert`s, so a user gets `Err` rather than a panic on malformed input).
- **Constants** (in `azure_data_cosmos::constants`): `THINCLIENT_PROXY_OPERATION_TYPE` → `x-ms-thinclient-proxy-operation-type`, `THINCLIENT_PROXY_RESOURCE_TYPE` → `x-ms-thinclient-proxy-resource-type`, `START_EPK` → `x-ms-start-epk`, `END_EPK` → `x-ms-end-epk`. Phase 2 reuses these verbatim (see §Phase 2 "Header naming" for mapping).
- **Perf crate** — `gateway20_allowed` config wiring

### 3.4 Gating model (single source of truth)

Two independent guards exist today (`is_gateway20_allowed` is checked in both routing and `get_dataplane_transport`). Per PR #3942 review, **routing is the single source of truth**; the transport-layer guard is intentional defense-in-depth and is technically dead code given current callers.

Invariants this spec locks in:

- `prefer_gateway20` is computed **once per request** during `resolve_endpoint` from:
  `connection_pool().is_gateway20_allowed() && account.has_thin_client_endpoints()`
- After `resolve_endpoint`, downstream stages MUST trust `RoutingDecision.transport_mode` and not re-derive eligibility.
- `ConnectionPoolOptions.is_gateway20_allowed` and its env var `AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTION_POOL_IS_GATEWAY20_ALLOWED` are an **unsupported, undocumented kill switch** reserved for emergency fallback. They are NOT exposed on `CosmosClientOptions` and may be removed without notice.

### 3.5 Known broken / do-not-use

- **`azure_data_cosmos::hash::get_hashed_partition_key_string()`** (called from `container_connection.rs:87`) — a legacy SDK-side function that is **a known-broken stub for MultiHash (hierarchical-PK) containers**. PR #4087's description explicitly calls it out as awaiting the SDK-to-driver cutover. **Do NOT** wire Phase 2 header injection to this function; use `EffectivePartitionKey::compute()` / `::compute_range()` (§3.3).

### 3.6 Not Yet Implemented (Gaps)

1. **RNTBD serialization/deserialization** — No binary protocol encoding/decoding exists
2. **Gateway 2.0 header injection** — Thin client proxy headers and EPK range headers are not applied to requests on the Gateway 2.0 path
3. **Supported operation filtering** — No `IsOperationSupportedByThinClient()` equivalent
4. **`x-ms-cosmos-use-thinclient` header** on account metadata requests (to trigger thin-client endpoint advertisement)
5. **SDK-to-driver cutover for EPK** — SDK call sites (`feed_range_from_partition_key`, `container_connection.rs:87`) still call the broken SDK hash; they must route through the driver's `EffectivePartitionKey::compute()`
6. **Session token handling** — Gateway 2.0 may handle session tokens differently (partition-key-range-id prefix)
7. **Gateway 2.0 specific fallback** — Failure-driven fallback from Gateway 2.0 to standard gateway (see Phase 4)
8. **Integration/E2E tests** — No gateway 2.0 test coverage beyond the routing-systems unit tests
9. **Fault injection** — No gateway 2.0 fault injection scenarios
10. **Constants cross-crate visibility** — `THINCLIENT_PROXY_*` and `START_EPK` / `END_EPK` currently live in `azure_data_cosmos::constants` but Phase 2 injects headers from the driver crate. Options (to decide in Phase 2): (a) move constants to `azure_data_cosmos_driver::constants` and re-export from SDK, (b) re-export SDK constants through a driver-side `pub use`, or (c) duplicate. Recommend (a).

## 4. Rust Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Current Request Flow (Gateway 1.0)

1. `CosmosClient::create_item(T)` calls `ContainerClient`
2. `container_connection.rs` serializes `T` to `&[u8]`, computes EPK (via the broken SDK hash today — see §3.5), resolves PKRange
3. `CosmosDriver::execute_operation()` enters the Operation Pipeline (7-stage loop)
4. `resolve_endpoint()` selects a gateway endpoint
5. Transport Pipeline applies cosmos headers, signs request
6. HTTP/REST request sent to Cosmos Gateway (shared proxy, no SLA)

### 4.2 Target Request Flow (Gateway 2.0)

1. `CosmosClient::create_item(T)` calls `ContainerClient`
2. `container_connection.rs` serializes `T` to `&[u8]`; EPK computation is deferred to the driver (via `EffectivePartitionKey::compute()` / `::compute_range()`), which then resolves PKRange
3. `CosmosDriver::execute_operation()` enters the Operation Pipeline (7-stage loop)
4. `resolve_endpoint()` prefers gateway 2.0 endpoint (if `prefer_gateway20` per §3.4)
5. Transport Pipeline checks `is_operation_supported_by_gateway20()`:
   - **YES**: Inject gateway 2.0 headers + RNTBD serialize → HTTP/2 POST to Gateway 2.0 Proxy (SLA)
   - **NO**: Standard HTTP/REST request to Cosmos Gateway (eligibility fallback — per-request, deterministic)

> **Naming**: The function is `is_operation_supported_by_gateway20()` throughout. Older drafts used `is_supported_by_gw20()` — do not reintroduce the abbreviation.

---

### Phase 1: RNTBD Protocol (Driver Layer)

**Crate**: `azure_data_cosmos_driver`
**New module**: `src/driver/transport/rntbd/`

The RNTBD (Reliable Network Transfer Binary Data) protocol is the wire format used by Cosmos DB for efficient binary communication. Gateway 2.0 wraps RNTBD-encoded payloads inside HTTP/2 POST requests to the proxy.

#### What Will Be Done

- **`rntbd/mod.rs`** — Module root, public types
- **`rntbd/request.rs`** — Request serialization: operation headers, resource metadata, partition key info → binary payload
- **`rntbd/response.rs`** — Response deserialization: 24-byte frame header → metadata section → optional body payload
- **`rntbd/tokens.rs`** — RNTBD token types (type IDs, lengths, value encodings) used in metadata sections
- **`rntbd/status.rs`** — RNTBD status code mapping to `CosmosStatus`

#### Versioning

Thin client RNTBD has no version negotiation on the wire. The proxy advertises a single supported frame format per endpoint and rejects mismatched frames at the HTTP layer (the HTTP/2 request fails rather than triggering an RNTBD version-mismatch error). Direct-mode RNTBD has version negotiation (`CURRENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION = 0x00000001`); **do not** apply that pattern here.

#### RNTBD Request Wire Format

The frame layout is derived from Java `com.azure.cosmos.implementation.directconnectivity.rntbd.RntbdRequestFrame.encode(...)`, which writes:

```java
out.writeIntLE(totalLength);
out.writeShortLE(resourceType.id());
out.writeShortLE(operationType.id());
RntbdUUID.encode(activityId, out);  // two longs
```

| Offset | Size | Field | Encoding | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | Total message length | uint32 LE | **Inclusive** of the 4 length bytes themselves (matches Java `writeIntLE` semantics). |
| 4 | 2 | Resource type | uint16 LE | `writeShortLE(resourceType.id())` — narrower than direct-mode RNTBD's uint32 because thin-client IDs fit in 16 bits. |
| 6 | 2 | Operation type | uint16 LE | `writeShortLE(operationType.id())` — same rationale. |
| 8 | 16 | Activity ID | UUID, two uint64 LE | Java writes `(mostSignificantBits, leastSignificantBits)` as two little-endian `long`s — **this is not RFC 4122 byte order**. Example: UUID `12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678` → bytes `78 56 34 12 34 12 78 56` (MSB LE) then `78 56 34 12 78 56 34 12` (LSB LE). |
| 24 | var | Metadata tokens | Token stream | Filtered by `thinClientProxyExcludedSet` (see §Phase 2 header naming). |
| 24+N | 4 | Payload length | uint32 LE | **Only present when the operation type implies a payload** (writes, patch, query body, stored-proc args, batch). Absence is signaled by operation-type convention, not a flag bit. Parsers must consult the operation-type → has-payload table derived from Java's `RntbdRequestArgs`. |
| 28+N | var | Payload body | Raw bytes | JSON or Cosmos binary, per resource type. |

#### RNTBD Response Wire Format

| Offset | Size | Field | Encoding | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | Total message length | uint32 LE | Inclusive of the 4 length bytes (same convention as request). |
| 4 | 4 | Status code | uint32 LE | Maps to HTTP status + `CosmosStatus`. |
| 8 | 16 | Activity ID | UUID, two uint64 LE | Same MSB-LE / LSB-LE pairing as request. |
| 24 | var | Metadata tokens | Token stream | Request charge, session token, continuation, etc. |
| 24+N | var | Body payload | Raw bytes | Optional; presence determined by total-length arithmetic (`total_length - header_and_tokens_len > 0`). |

```

---

### Phase 2: Gateway 2.0 Request Pipeline (Driver Layer)

**Crate**: `azure_data_cosmos_driver`

This phase wires RNTBD serialization into the existing transport pipeline and adds gateway 2.0-specific header injection.

#### What Will Be Done

- **Operation filtering** — `is_operation_supported_by_gateway20(resource_type, operation_type) → bool`. Following Java (`ThinClientStoreModel`), only `ResourceType::Document` operations are eligible. The .NET position (`IsOperationSupportedByThinClient` additionally allows `StoredProcedure::ExecuteJavaScript`) is **intentionally not adopted**.
- **EPK computation** — Call `EffectivePartitionKey::compute()` (point) or `::compute_range()` (feed/cross-partition) from the driver layer. Do **not** call `azure_data_cosmos::hash::get_hashed_partition_key_string` (§3.5). SDK call sites that currently use it must route through the driver's implementation as part of this phase.
- **EPK error propagation** — If EPK computation returns `Err` (MultiHash-requires-V2, component-count mismatch, etc.), surface as `CosmosStatus::BadRequest` to the caller. **Do not** fall back to standard gateway — the same inputs would be equally broken there.
- **Header injection** — When `transport_mode == Gateway20`, inject the thin-client headers listed below.
- **Request body wrapping** — Serialize the entire request (headers + body) into RNTBD binary format and POST as the HTTP/2 body.
- **Response unwrapping** — Deserialize the RNTBD response body back into `CosmosResponseHeaders` + raw document bytes.
- **Eligibility fallback** — Operation ineligible for Gateway 2.0 → route through standard gateway for this single request (per-request, deterministic). See §Phase 4 for the distinct failure-driven fallback.
- **Constants placement** — Resolve the cross-crate constants question from §3.6-10 (recommend: move `THINCLIENT_PROXY_*` and `START_EPK` / `END_EPK` to a driver-side module, re-export from SDK).

#### Supported Operations

Only `ResourceType::Document` is eligible for gateway 2.0 (following Java's approach):

| Operation | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | Yes | |
| Read | Yes | |
| Replace | Yes | |
| Upsert | Yes | |
| Delete | Yes | |
| Patch | Yes | |
| Query | Yes | |
| QueryPlan | Yes | |
| ReadFeed | Yes | LatestVersion change feed only; excludes AllVersionsAndDeletes |
| Batch | Yes | Transactional same-PK batch (single resource, single request). |
| Bulk | Yes | SDK-side fan-out of independent CRUD ops; each fan-out leg is a separate eligible Document op. Distinct from Batch. |
| StoredProcedure Execute | **No** | Following Java; Rust does **not** follow .NET's `ExecuteJavaScript` allowance. |
| All other resource types | **No** | Metadata operations use standard gateway |

#### Header naming (proxy headers, in HTTP/2 request headers — not RNTBD tokens)

These are wire-level HTTP/2 request headers on the outer POST to the proxy. They are **not** inside the RNTBD metadata token stream.

| Header (wire) | Rust constant (crate) | Semantics | When emitted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x-ms-thinclient-proxy-operation-type` | `THINCLIENT_PROXY_OPERATION_TYPE` (SDK today; move to driver per §3.6-10) | Numeric operation type | Every Gateway 2.0 request |
| `x-ms-thinclient-proxy-resource-type` | `THINCLIENT_PROXY_RESOURCE_TYPE` (SDK today; move) | Numeric resource type | Every Gateway 2.0 request |
| `x-ms-effective-partition-key` | **NEW** — `EFFECTIVE_PARTITION_KEY` (driver) | Canonical EPK hex | Point ops only |
| `x-ms-thinclient-range-min` | **Reuse** `START_EPK` (= `x-ms-start-epk`) — confirm header name with service, or add new constant if the proxy requires `x-ms-thinclient-range-min` literally | Lower bound of EPK range | Feed / cross-partition ops only |
| `x-ms-thinclient-range-max` | **Reuse** `END_EPK` (= `x-ms-end-epk`) — same caveat | Upper bound of EPK range | Feed / cross-partition ops only |
| `x-ms-cosmos-use-thinclient` | **NEW** (driver) | Instructs account-metadata response to advertise thin-client endpoints | Account metadata fetches only |

**Action item for Phase 2**: confirm with the service team whether the proxy expects `x-ms-start-epk` / `x-ms-end-epk` (existing constants) or `x-ms-thinclient-range-min` / `x-ms-thinclient-range-max` (Java naming). If the latter, introduce new constants and retire the former on the Gateway 2.0 path.

#### Range header wire format

EPK range headers (`x-ms-thinclient-range-min` / `-max`) carry the canonical, un-padded hex produced by `EffectivePartitionKey::compute_range()`. **Do not** zero-pad to N×32 on the wire. Local comparisons use `epk_length_aware_cmp` (in `container_routing_map.rs`, introduced by PR #4087) which correctly handles the mixed-length boundaries returned by the backend. `@analogrelay`'s earlier zero-padding proposal was **not** adopted; stay consistent with the length-aware convention.

> **`Range` semantics footgun** (from PR #4087): `compute_range` returns a Rust `std::ops::Range<EffectivePartitionKey>` where `start == end` denotes a **point operation**. Standard `Range` iteration treats that as empty, so code that uses `.contains()` or iterates the range directly will misbehave. Always treat `start == end` as the point case explicitly.

#### Gateway 2.0 Header Injection Flow

When `transport_mode == Gateway20`:

1. Set `x-ms-thinclient-proxy-operation-type` (numeric operation type)
2. Set `x-ms-thinclient-proxy-resource-type` (numeric resource type)
3. Point operation? Set `x-ms-effective-partition-key` (EPK hash from `EffectivePartitionKey::compute()`)
   Feed operation? Set `x-ms-thinclient-range-min` and `x-ms-thinclient-range-max` (from `EffectivePartitionKey::compute_range()`)
4. Serialize headers + body into RNTBD binary format (Phase 1)
5. POST RNTBD body to gateway 2.0 endpoint via HTTP/2

When `transport_mode != Gateway20`: Standard HTTP/REST request (existing flow, unchanged).

### Phase 3: Endpoint Discovery — verification & one new header

**Crate**: `azure_data_cosmos_driver`

> Most of Phase 3 is **audit / verification** against scaffolding already in place (§3.1, §3.2). Only the `x-ms-cosmos-use-thinclient` request header is net-new code. Noted here because the dependency graph lists Phase 3 as a prerequisite for Phase 2; in practice the verification items can happen in parallel with Phase 1 and the one real code change can ride with Phase 2 if convenient.

#### What Will Be Done

- **Verify** account metadata cache parses `thinClientReadableLocations` / `thinClientWritableLocations` into `CosmosEndpoint::gateway20_url` (existing, per §3.2)
- **Confirm** `build_account_endpoint_state()` constructs `CosmosEndpoint::regional_with_gateway20()` correctly in multi-region accounts (existing tests at `routing_systems.rs:218–289` already cover this)
- **Verify** `AccountProperties::has_thin_client_endpoints()` is used as the gating signal per §3.4
- **Add** `x-ms-cosmos-use-thinclient` request header on account metadata fetches (new code)
- **Test** endpoint discovery with live account that has gateway 2.0 enabled (handled by Phase 6 live pipeline)

#### Region pairing (lock in the §PR #3942 decision)

Thin-client read locations pair **only** with read regions; thin-client write locations pair **only** with write regions. A write region that advertises no thin-client URL falls back to standard gateway **for writes** (this was deliberate in PR #3942: session retries that reroute reads to write endpoints would otherwise cross the read/write thin-client split). This is a correctness invariant — do not "fix" it by cross-pairing.

#### Endpoint Discovery Flow (Existing)

Account metadata response includes:

- `writableLocations` — standard gateway URLs
- `readableLocations` — standard gateway URLs
- `thinClientWritableLocations` — gateway 2.0 URLs (when available)
- `thinClientReadableLocations` — gateway 2.0 URLs (when available)

`build_account_endpoint_state()` matches regions across these lists and constructs `CosmosEndpoint::regional_with_gateway20(region, gw_url, gw20_url)`. The resulting `AccountEndpointState` contains endpoints with `gateway20_url: Some(...)` when gateway 2.0 is available for that region.

#### Files Changed

```
EDIT  src/driver/cache/account_metadata_cache.rs   — Verify thin client endpoint parsing (audit only)
EDIT  src/driver/transport/cosmos_headers.rs       — Add x-ms-cosmos-use-thinclient header (NEW)
TEST  src/driver/routing/routing_systems.rs        — Add tests for read/write pairing edge cases
```

---

### Phase 4: Retry & Error Handling (Driver Layer)

**Crate**: `azure_data_cosmos_driver`

Retry policies are identical between Gateway 2.0 and standard gateway modes in both Java and .NET — only endpoint selection and request encoding differ. The existing retry pipeline should work as-is for most cases.

#### What Will Be Done

- **Timeout policy** — Gateway 2.0 requests use the timeout regime defined in `TRANSPORT_PIPELINE_SPEC.md` (single timeout, not bifurcated). Do not introduce Gateway-2.0-specific timeouts.
- **Read timeout cross-region retry** — On HTTP 408 with `GATEWAY_ENDPOINT_READ_TIMEOUT` sub-status, retry read operations in the next preferred region.
- **Service unavailable (503)** — Mark endpoint unavailable for partition key range, then retry. Follow Java's conservative approach: only retry server-returned 503 or SDK-generated 503 with `SERVER_GENERATED_410` sub-status.
- **Gone (410)** — Action depends on sub-status code:
  - `PARTITION_KEY_RANGE_GONE` (1002): Refresh PKRange cache, retry
  - `COMPLETING_SPLIT_OR_MERGE` (1007): Refresh PKRange cache, retry
  - `COMPLETING_PARTITION_MIGRATION` (1008): Refresh PKRange cache, retry
  - `NAME_CACHE_IS_STALE` (1000): Refresh **collection** cache (NOT PKRange), retry
  - Other sub-statuses: Retry with backoff, no cache refresh
- **Gateway 2.0 failure-driven fallback** — see "Fallback taxonomy" below.
- **Partition-Level Failover interaction** — when PLF (see `PARTITION_LEVEL_FAILOVER_SPEC.md`) selects a region whose `CosmosEndpoint` has no `gateway20_url`, **PLF wins**: the request falls back to standard gateway **for that partition** until PLF releases its override. PLF precedence prevents Gateway 2.0 from overriding an explicit per-partition region choice.

#### Fallback taxonomy

Two distinct fallback mechanisms — do not conflate them:

| Name | Scope | Trigger | Duration | Unwind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Eligibility fallback** | Per-request | Operation is not eligible for Gateway 2.0 (fails `is_operation_supported_by_gateway20()`) | Single request only | N/A — recomputed every request |
| **Failure fallback** | Per-partition, sticky | N consecutive 503 `Proxy unreachable` or equivalent within a rolling window (target N=3, window=30s — confirm in implementation tuning) | Sticky until unwind | (a) next successful account-metadata refresh removes the affected `gateway20_url`, OR (b) a periodic probe to the proxy succeeds, OR (c) a fixed cooldown (target 60s) expires, whichever is first |

Failure fallback is per-partition rather than per-client so that one bad proxy region does not degrade requests to other partitions. Client-lifetime stickiness is explicitly **not** used — it would prevent recovery within the process.

#### Retry Decision Table

| Response | Sub-Status | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200-299 | — | Success |
| 404 | — | Not Found (propagate to caller) |
| 408 Timeout | — | Read: retry cross-region; Write: retry local only |
| 410 Gone | 1002 (PKRangeGone) | Refresh PKRange cache, retry |
| 410 Gone | 1007 (SplitMerge) | Refresh PKRange cache, retry |
| 410 Gone | 1008 (PartitionMigration) | Refresh PKRange cache, retry |
| 410 Gone | 1000 (NameCacheStale) | Refresh **collection** cache, retry |
| 410 Gone | other | Retry with backoff |
| 429 Throttled | — | Existing throttle retry loop (unchanged) |
| 449 Retry With | — | Retry same region (transient conflict) |
| 503 Unavailable | server-returned | Mark endpoint unavailable, failover; increment failure-fallback counter |
| 503 Unavailable | SDK-generated | Only retry if `SERVER_GENERATED_410` sub-status |
| Proxy unreachable | — | Increment failure-fallback counter; if threshold crossed, enter Failure fallback (§Fallback taxonomy) and route remainder through `TransportMode::Gateway` |

### Phase 5: SDK Integration

**Crate**: `azure_data_cosmos`

Gateway 2.0 is **not exposed as a customer-facing configuration**. The SDK automatically uses gateway 2.0 when the account metadata advertises thin client endpoints. This matches the design philosophy of both Java and .NET SDKs.

#### What Will Be Done

- **Auto-detection** — When account metadata includes `thinClientReadableLocations` / `thinClientWritableLocations`, the driver automatically prefers gateway 2.0 for eligible operations (per §3.4). No user opt-in required.
- **Internal kill switch** — `ConnectionPoolOptions.is_gateway20_allowed` and its env var (§3.4) remain internal. They are NOT exposed in `CosmosClientOptions` and are unsupported/undocumented.
- **Diagnostics** — `CosmosDiagnostics` should report when a request used gateway 2.0 vs standard gateway (already partially done via `TransportKind::Gateway20`).
- **User agent** — Update SDK user agent string to indicate gateway 2.0 capability.
- **EPK cutover** — Replace SDK-side callers of `get_hashed_partition_key_string` with calls into the driver's `EffectivePartitionKey::compute()` / `::compute_range()` (this is the cutover PR #4087 flagged). Gateway 2.0 header injection depends on this being correct for hierarchical-PK containers.

#### Auto-Detection Flow

When account metadata includes `thinClientReadableLocations`, gateway 2.0 is enabled automatically (internal). `CosmosEndpoint` gets `gateway20_url` and `resolve_endpoint()` prefers Gateway 2.0 (per §3.4's single-source-of-truth rule). No user configuration needed — transparent to the caller.

### Phase 6: Testing

Testing covers all layers from unit to E2E, matching or exceeding Java/.NET test coverage.

#### Live Tests Pipeline

A **new dedicated CI pipeline** is required for gateway 2.0 live tests. Gateway 2.0 requires a Cosmos DB account with thin client endpoints enabled, which is separate from the standard emulator and live test infrastructure.

**Trigger:** PR changes to `sdk/cosmos/**` + manual dispatch

**Provision:**

- Use a **dedicated, pre-provisioned Cosmos DB account** with gateway 2.0 / thin client endpoints enabled (hardcoded for this pipeline, reused across runs)
- Account credentials stored in pipeline secrets (e.g., `AZURE_COSMOS_GW20_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_COSMOS_GW20_KEY`)
- Multi-region configuration (at least 2 regions)
- Verify `thinClientReadableLocations` in account metadata at pipeline start

**Test Matrix:**

- Single-region gateway 2.0
- Multi-region gateway 2.0 with failover
- Gateway 2.0 + standard gateway fallback (both eligibility and failure-driven)

**Test Suites:**

- Point CRUD (create, read, replace, upsert, patch, delete)
- Query (single-partition, cross-partition)
- Batch operations
- Change feed (LatestVersion)
- Retry scenarios (408, 410, 503)
- Diagnostics validation (`TransportKind::Gateway20`)

**Artifacts:** Test results (JUnit XML), diagnostics logs, perf metrics (RU, latency)

### Phase Dependency Graph

- **Phase 1** (RNTBD Protocol) and the verification parts of **Phase 3** (Endpoint Discovery) can proceed in parallel
- **Phase 2** (Request Pipeline) depends on Phase 1, and folds in Phase 3's one new header (`x-ms-cosmos-use-thinclient`)
- **Phase 4** (Retry/Errors) and **Phase 5** (SDK Integration) depend on Phase 2
- **Phase 6** (Testing) depends on all previous phases

## 5. Open Questions

- **Q1 — HTTP/2 prior knowledge vs ALPN**: Rust already configures gateway 2.0 as HTTP/2 with prior knowledge. `TRANSPORT_PIPELINE_SPEC.md` settled ALPN as the default negotiation for the broader sharded transport. **Need service team confirmation** on which the Gateway 2.0 proxy expects. _Resolution_: pending.
- **Q2 — Live test account provisioning**: Cosmos DB account configuration flags required to enable gateway 2.0 / thin client endpoints are not part of the standard Bicep templates. _Resolution_: hardcode a dedicated, pre-provisioned thin client account for the gateway 2.0 live tests pipeline and reuse it across runs (rather than provisioning per-run via Bicep). Account name and credentials stored in pipeline secrets (`AZURE_COSMOS_GW20_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_COSMOS_GW20_KEY`); pipeline reads endpoint from environment variables.
- **Q3 — EPK range header names**: Does the Gateway 2.0 proxy accept `x-ms-start-epk` / `x-ms-end-epk` (existing Rust constants) or require `x-ms-thinclient-range-min` / `x-ms-thinclient-range-max` (Java naming)? _Resolution_: pending Phase 2 confirmation with service team.
- **Q4 — Failure-fallback thresholds**: Target values are N=3 consecutive 503s in a 30s window, 60s cooldown. _Resolution_: pending implementation tuning against live test pipeline data.
