/// Result of a retry policy decision
///
/// This enum represents the outcome of evaluating whether an HTTP request should be retried
/// after encountering an error or receiving a response that may warrant a retry (such as
/// transient failures, rate limiting, or service unavailability).
///
/// # Variants
///
/// * `DoNotRetry` - The operation should not be retried. This is returned for successful
///   responses, permanent failures, or when retry limits have been exhausted.
///
/// * `Retry { after }` - The operation should be retried after waiting for the specified
///   duration. The delay allows for exponential backoff or respects server-provided retry
///   hints (e.g., from `Retry-After` headers).
