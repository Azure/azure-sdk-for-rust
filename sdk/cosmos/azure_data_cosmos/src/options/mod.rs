/// # Conditions are not exposed
///
/// PATCH intentionally does **not** expose either flavor of "condition" that
/// peer SDKs surface on their PATCH options:
///
/// * **`Precondition` (`If-Match` / `If-None-Match`).** The handler owns the
///   `If-Match` precondition on the internal Replace and captures the ETag
///   off the matching Read; honoring a caller-set value would either shadow
///   that ETag (silently breaking the RMW guarantee) or require resolving
///   it against the handler's own ETag (no sensible merge). The driver-side
///   PATCH handler rejects any caller-set precondition with an error before
///   issuing any sub-operation.
/// * **SQL filter predicate** (peer SDKs' `FilterPredicate`). Predicate
///   evaluation requires either native wire-level PATCH (so the server
///   evaluates the predicate inside the same transaction) or a client-side
///   SQL subset evaluator; neither is in scope for this preview. The
///   driver's [`PatchInstructions`](crate::PatchInstructions) has no `condition` field, so
///   there is no way to attach a predicate to a PATCH request.
///
/// The session token lives on the dedicated
/// [`session_token`](Self::session_token) field (mirroring
/// [`ItemReadOptions`] / [`ItemWriteOptions`]). All other general-purpose
/// settings (custom headers, content response behavior, excluded regions,
/// etc.) are configured via [`operation`](Self::operation) — see
/// [`OperationOptions`] for details.
///
/// # Latency
///
/// Because every PATCH is at minimum a Read followed by a Replace, the
/// best-case round-trip floor for ``patch_item`` is **2× the single-RTT
/// cost** of a comparable Read or Replace against the same partition.
/// Each retry triggered by a 412 PreconditionFailed adds another full
/// Read+Replace pair to the wall-clock cost.
///
/// When configuring an end-to-end latency budget via
/// [`OperationOptions`]'s end-to-end request settings, size the budget
/// accordingly — a useful rule of thumb is **≥ 2× the p99 single-RTT
/// budget you would set for a plain Replace**, plus headroom for any
/// 412 retries you want to tolerate. Setting the budget too low can
/// cancel the RMW between the Read and the Replace, producing a
/// timeout error even when the service is healthy.
