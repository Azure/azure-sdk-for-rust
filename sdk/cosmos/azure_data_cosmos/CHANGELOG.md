### Other Changes

## 0.26.0 (2025-08-06)

## 0.25.0 (2025-08-05)

### Features Added
* Added `if_match_etag` to `ItemOptions` ([#2705](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2705))
* Added several more options to `ItemOptions`: `pre_triggers`, `post_triggers`, `session_token`, `consistency_level`, and `indexing_directive` ([#2744](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2744))

### Breaking Changes

- Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.85.

## 0.24.0 (2025-06-10)

### Features Added

* Added a function `CosmosClient::with_connection_string` to enable `CosmosClient` creation via connection string. ([#2641](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2641))
* Added support for executing limited cross-partition queries through the Gateway. See <https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/cosmos-db/querying-cosmosdb-resources-using-the-rest-api#queries-that-cannot-be-served-by-gateway> for more details on these limitations. ([#2577](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2577))
* Added a preview feature (behind `preview_query_engine` feature flag) to allow the Rust SDK to integrate with an external query engine for performing cross-partition queries. ([#2577](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2577))

### Breaking Changes

* `FeedPager<T>` now asynchronously iterates items of type `T` instead of pages containing items of type `T`. Call `FeedPager::into_pages()` to get a `PageIterator` to asynchronously iterate over all pages. ([#2665](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2665))

## 0.23.0 (2025-05-06)

### Features Added

* Decoupled query responses from HTTP to allow for handling non-HTTP transports for queries. ([#2393](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2393))

### Breaking Changes

* Query APIs (`CosmosClient::query_databases`, `DatabaseClient::query_containers`, `ContainerClient::query_items`) now return a `FeedPager` instead of an `azure_core::Pager`. The `FeedPager` type provides an abstraction over the transport layer, allowing for more flexibility when queries are executed over non-HTTP transports or are decoupled from specific HTTP responses (such as in cross-partition queries). ([#2393](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2393))

## 0.22.1 (2025-03-05)

### Bugs Fixed

* Fixed a publishing issue that caused the `key_auth` feature to be omitted. ([#2241](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues/2241))

## 0.22.0 (2025-02-25)

### Features Added

* Initial supported release.
