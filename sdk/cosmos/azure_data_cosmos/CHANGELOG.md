# Release History

## 0.24.0 (Unreleased)

### Features Added

* Added a function `CosmosClient::with_connection_string` to enable `CosmosClient` creation via connection string. ([#2641](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2641))

### Breaking Changes

* `FeedPager<T>` now asynchronously iterates items of type `T` instead of pages containing items of type `T`. Call `FeedPager::into_pages()` to get a `PageIterator` to asynchronously iterate over all pages.

### Bugs Fixed

### Other Changes

## 0.23.0 (2025-05-06)

### Features Added

* Decoupled query responses from HTTP to allow for handling non-HTTP transports for queries. ([#2393](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2393))

### Breaking Changes

* Query APIs (`CosmosClient::query_databases`, `DatabaseClient::query_containers`, `ContainerClient::query_items`) now return a `FeedPager` instead of an `azure_core::Pager`. The `FeedPager` type provides an abstraction over the transport layer, allowing for more flexibility when queries are executed over non-HTTP transports or are decoupled from specific HTTP responses (such as in cross-partition queries). ([#2393](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/pull/2393))

## 0.22.1 (2025-03-05)

### Bugs Fixed

* Fixed a publishing issue that caused the `key_auth` feature to be omitted. ([#2241](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues/2241))

## 0.22.0 (2025-02-25)

### Features Added

* Initial supported release.
