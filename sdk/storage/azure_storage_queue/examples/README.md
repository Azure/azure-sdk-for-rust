# Storage Queue Examples

This directory contains a set of example for the use of the Storage Queue clients.

## Setup

The following environment variables need to be set:

- `AZURE_QUEUE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<storage_account_name>`
- `AZURE_QUEUE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_SAS_URL=<storage_account_sas_url>` (This is the queue service URL with a SAS token appended without the queue name)
