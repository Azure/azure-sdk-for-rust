/// Execution pipeline.
///
/// A pipeline follows a precise flow:
///
/// 1. Client library-specified per-call policies are executed. Per-call policies can fail and bail out of the pipeline
///    immediately.
/// 2. User-specified per-call policies are executed.
/// 3. Telemetry policy.
/// 4. Retry policy. It allows to re-execute the following policies.
/// 5. Client library-specified per-retry policies. Per-retry polices are always executed at least once but are re-executed
///    in case of retries.
/// 6. User-specified per-retry policies are executed.
/// 7. Authorization policy. Authorization can depend on the HTTP headers and/or the request body so it
///    must be executed right before sending the request to the transport. Also, the authorization
///    can depend on the current time so it must be executed at every retry.
/// 8. Transport policy. Transport policy is always the last policy and is the policy that
///    actually constructs the `Response` to be passed up the pipeline.
///
/// A pipeline is immutable. In other words a policy can either succeed and call the following
/// policy of fail and return to the calling policy. Arbitrary policy "skip" must be avoided (but
/// cannot be enforced by code). All policies except Transport policy can assume there is another following policy (so
/// self.pipeline[0] is always valid).
///
/// The `C` generic contains the pipeline-specific context. Different crates can pass
/// different contexts using this generic. This way each crate can have its own specific pipeline
/// context. For example, in CosmosDB, the generic carries the operation-specific information used by
/// the authorization policy.
