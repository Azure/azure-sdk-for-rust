/// - TracerProvider: This trait is responsible for providing tracers - this is the
///   entrypoint for distributed tracing in the SDK.
/// - Tracer: This trait is responsible for creating spans and managing the active span.
/// - Span: This trait represents a single unit of work in the distributed tracing system.
