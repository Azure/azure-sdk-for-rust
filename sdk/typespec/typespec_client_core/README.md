# TypeSpec Client Runtime

This is the runtime for [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io)-generated clients.

## Features

- `debug`: enables extra information for developers e.g., emitting all fields in `std::fmt::Debug` implementation.
- `decimal`: enables support for `rust_decimal::Decimal` type.
- `derive`: enable derive macros e.g., `SafeDebug`.
- `http` (default): enables HTTP support.
- `json` (default): enables JSON support.
- `reqwest` (default): enables and sets `reqwest` as the default `HttpClient`. Enables `reqwest`'s `native-tls` feature.
- `reqwest_deflate` (default): enables deflate compression for `reqwest`.
- `reqwest_gzip` (default): enables gzip compression for `reqwest`.
- `reqwest_native-tls` (default): enables `reqwest`'s `native-tls` feature, which uses schannel on Windows and openssl elsewhere.
- `tokio`: enables and sets `tokio` as the default async runtime.
- `wasm_bindgen`: enables the async runtime for WASM.
- `xml`: enables XML support.

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

To help protected end users from accidental Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) from leaking into logs or traces, models' default implementation of `core::fmt::Debug` formats as non-exhaustive structure tuple e.g.,

```rust ignore
#[macro_use]
use typespec_client_core::fmt::SafeDebug;

#[derive(SafeDebug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

let p = Person {
    name: "Any One".into(),
};
println!("{p:?}");
```

By default this will print:

```text
Person { .. }
```

Though not recommended for production, you can enable normal `core::fmt::Debug` formatting complete with field names and values by enabling the `debug` feature of `typespec_client_core` e.g.,

```sh
cargo add typespec_client_core -F debug
```

### Known issues

#### Hang when invoking multiple HTTP operations using the default HTTP transport

Some customers have reported hangs when using the default `reqwest` HTTP transport.
The issue is tracked in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2312).
The recommended workaround is to disable connection pooling in a custom `reqwest` transport.

If you are encountering this issue, you can construct an `HttpClient` which disables HTTP connection pooling
and set that as the transport in any `ClientOptions` used to configure your clients:

```rust no_run
use std::sync::Arc;
use typespec_client_core::http::{HttpClient, ClientOptions, TransportOptions};

let client = Arc::new(
    ::reqwest::ClientBuilder::new()
        // Note that reqwest does not support `pool_max_idle_per_host` on WASM.
        .pool_max_idle_per_host(0)
        .build()
        .expect("failed to build `reqwest` client"),
);

let options = ClientOptions {
    transport: Some(TransportOptions::new(client.clone())),
    ..Default::default()
};
```

Note that implementing this workaround can result in a significant performance slowdown depending on your scenario.
