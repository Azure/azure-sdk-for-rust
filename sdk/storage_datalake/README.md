## The Storage Datalake crate

`azure-storage-datalake` offers functionality needed to interact with an ADLS Gen2 storage account from Rust.
As an abstraction over the [Azure Data Lake Store REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/data-lake-storage-gen2), anything that is possible through that Rest API
should also be possible with this crate.
