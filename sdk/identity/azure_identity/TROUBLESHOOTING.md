## Handle azure_identity errors

Any service client method that makes a request to the service may return an error due to authentication failure. This is because the credential authenticates on the first call to the service and on any subsequent call that needs to refresh an access token. Authentication errors include a description of the failure and possibly an error message from Microsoft Entra ID. Depending on the application, these errors may or may not be recoverable.

### Permission issues

Service client errors with a status code of 401 or 403 often indicate that authentication succeeded but the caller doesn't have permission to access the specified API. Check the service documentation to determine which RBAC roles are needed for the request, and ensure the authenticated user or service principal has the appropriate role assignments.

## Find relevant information in errors

Authentication errors can include responses from Microsoft Entra ID and often contain information helpful in diagnosis. Consider the following error message:

```
Error: ClientSecretCredential authentication failed. AADSTS7000215: Invalid client secret provided. Ensure the secret being sent in the request is the client secret value, not the client secret ID, for a secret added to app '<client ID>'. Trace ID: d05377ee-e3ab-4d37-bab7-d46f530b7401 Correlation ID: 1ef06246-3841-470a-860f-ab1b78f325a5 Timestamp: 2025-06-03 16:13:57Z
```

This error contains several pieces of information:

- __Failing Credential Type__: The type of credential that failed to authenticate. This can be helpful when diagnosing issues with chained credential types such as `DefaultAzureCredential` or `ChainedTokenCredential`.

- __Microsoft Entra ID Error Code and Message__: The error code and message returned by Microsoft Entra ID. This can give insight into the specific reason the request failed. For instance, in this case authentication failed because the provided client secret is incorrect. [Microsoft Entra ID documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/reference-error-codes#aadsts-error-codes) has more information on AADSTS error codes.

- __Correlation ID and Timestamp__: The correlation ID and timestamp identify the request in server-side logs. This information can be useful to support engineers diagnosing unexpected Microsoft Entra failures.

## Troubleshoot ClientSecretCredential authentication issues

| Error Code | Issue | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
|AADSTS7000215|An invalid client secret was provided.|Ensure the secret provided to the credential constructor is valid. If unsure, create a new client secret using the Azure portal.

## Troubleshoot ManagedIdentityCredential authentication issues

`ManagedIdentityCredential` is designed to work on a variety of Azure hosts support managed identity. Configuration and troubleshooting vary from host to host. The below table lists the Azure hosts that can be assigned a managed identity and are supported by `ManagedIdentityCredential`.

|Host Environment| | |
|---|---|---|
|Azure Virtual Machines and Scale Sets|[Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm)|[Troubleshooting](#azure-virtual-machine-managed-identity)|
|Azure App Service and Azure Functions|[Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity)|[Troubleshooting](#azure-app-service-and-azure-functions-managed-identity)|

### Azure Virtual Machine managed identity

| Error Message |Description| Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
|The requested identity hasn’t been assigned to this resource.|The IMDS endpoint responded with a status code of 400, indicating the requested identity isn’t assigned to the VM.|If using a user assigned identity, ensure the specified ID is correct.<p/><p/>If using a system assigned identity, make sure it has been enabled as described in [managed identity documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm#enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-on-an-existing-vm).|
|The request failed due to a gateway error.|The request to the IMDS endpoint failed due to a gateway error, 502 or 504 status code.|IMDS doesn't support requests via proxy or gateway. Disable proxies or gateways running on the VM for requests to the IMDS endpoint `http://169.254.169.254`|
|Connection timed out|No response was received for the request to IMDS or the request timed out.|<ul><li>Ensure the VM is configured for managed identity as described in [managed identity documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm).</li><li>Verify the IMDS endpoint is reachable on the VM. See [below](#verify-imds-is-available-on-the-vm) for instructions.</li></ul>|

#### Verify IMDS is available on the VM

If you have access to the VM, you can use `curl` to verify the managed identity endpoint is available.

```sh
curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net&api-version=2018-02-01' -H "Metadata: true"
```

> If successful, this command's output will contain an access token that SHOULD NOT BE SHARED, to avoid compromising account security.

### Azure App Service and Azure Functions managed identity

| Error Message |Description| Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
|Connection timed out with url: "http://169.254.169.254/..."|The App Service host hasn't set environment variables for managed identity configuration.|<ul><li>Ensure the App Service is configured for managed identity as described in [App Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity).</li><li>Verify the App Service environment is properly configured and the managed identity endpoint is available. See [below](#verify-the-app-service-managed-identity-endpoint-is-available) for instructions.</li></ul>|

#### Verify the App Service managed identity endpoint is available

If you can SSH into the App Service, you can verify managed identity is available in the environment. First ensure the environment variables `IDENTITY_ENDPOINT` and `IDENTITY_SECRET` are set. Then you can verify the managed identity endpoint is available using `curl`.

```sh
curl "$IDENTITY_ENDPOINT?resource=https://management.core.windows.net&api-version=2019-08-01" -H "X-IDENTITY-HEADER: $IDENTITY_HEADER"
```

> If successful, this command's output will contain an access token that SHOULD NOT BE SHARED, to avoid compromising account security.

You can get this from the Azure CLI: `az account show --name "[your subscription]" --query "id"`

#### Verify the Azure CLI can obtain tokens

You can manually verify that the Azure CLI can authenticate and obtain tokens. First, use the `account` command to verify the logged in account.

```azurecli
az account show
```

Once you've verified the Azure CLI is using the correct account, you can validate that it's able to obtain tokens for that account.

```azurecli
az account get-access-token --output json --scope https://management.core.windows.net/.default
```

> This command's output will contain an access token and SHOULD NOT BE SHARED, to avoid compromising account security.

#### Verify the Azure Developer CLI can obtain tokens

You can manually verify that the Azure Developer CLI is properly authenticated and can obtain tokens. First, use the `config` command to verify the account that is currently logged in to the Azure Developer CLI.

```sh
azd config list
```

Once you've verified the Azure Developer CLI is using correct account, you can validate that it's able to obtain tokens for this account.

```sh
azd auth token --output json --scope https://management.core.windows.net/.default
```

> This command's output will contain an access token and SHOULD NOT BE SHARED, to avoid compromising account security.
