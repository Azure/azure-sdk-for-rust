# Azure Event Hubs client library for Rust

[Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/) is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service from Microsoft. For more information about Event Hubs see [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about).

The Azure Event Hubs client library allows you to send single events or batches of events to an event hub and consume events from an event hub.

[Source code] | [Package (crates.io)] | [API reference documentation] | [Product documentation]

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Event Hubs client library for Rust with [Cargo]:

```sh
cargo add azure_messaging_eventhubs
```

### Prerequisites

* A Rust Compiler. See [the rust compiler installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* An [Azure subscription]
* The [Azure CLI]
* An [Event Hub namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/).
* An Event Hub instance. You can create an Event Hub instance in your Event Hubs Namespace using the [Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create), or the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quickstart-cli).

If you use the Azure CLI, replace `<your-resource-group-name>`, `<your-eventhubs-namespace-name>`, and `<your-eventhub-name>` with your own, unique names:

Create an Event Hubs Namespace:

```azurecli
az eventhubs namespace create --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-eventhubs-namespace-name> --sku Standard
```

Create an Event Hub Instance:

```azurecli
az eventhubs eventhub create --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --namespace-name <your-eventhubs-namespace-name> --name <your-eventhub-name>
```

### Install dependencies

Add the following crates to your project:

```sh
cargo add azure_identity tokio
```

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Azure Event Hubs service, you'll need to create an instance of the `ProducerClient` or the `ConsumerClient`. You need an **event hub namespace host URL** (which you may see as `serviceBusEndpoint` in the Azure CLI response when creating the Even Hubs Namespace), an **Event Hub name** (which you may see as `name` in the Azure CLI response when crating the Event Hub instance), and credentials to instantiate a client object.

The example shown below uses a `DeveloperToolsCredential`, which is appropriate for most local development environments. Additionally, we recommend using a managed identity for authentication in production environments. You can find more information on different ways of authenticating and their corresponding credential types in the [Azure Identity] documentation.

The `DeveloperToolsCredential` will automatically pick up on an Azure CLI authentication. Ensure you are logged in with the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az login
```

Instantiate a `DeveloperToolsCredential` to pass to the client. The same instance of a token credential can be used with multiple clients if they will be authenticating with the same identity.

### Create an Event Hubs message producer and send an event

```rust no_run
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;
use azure_messaging_eventhubs::ProducerClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let host = "<EVENTHUBS_HOST>";
    let eventhub = "<EVENTHUB_NAME>";

    // Create new credential
    let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;

    // Create and open a new ProducerClient
    let producer = ProducerClient::builder()
        .open(host, eventhub, credential.clone())
        .await?;

    producer.send_event(vec![1, 2, 3, 4], None).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Key concepts

An Event Hub [**namespace**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#namespace) can have multiple Event Hub instances.
Each Event Hub instance, in turn, contains [**partitions**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#partitions) which store events.

<!-- NOTE: Fix dead links -->

Events are published to an Event Hub instance using an [event publisher](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-publishers). In this package, the event publisher is the [`ProducerClient`][producer_client]

Events can be consumed from an Event Hub instance using an [event consumer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers).

Consuming events is done using an `EventReceiver`, which can be opened from the [`ConsumerClient`][consumer_client]. This is useful if you already known which partitions you want to receive from.

<!--
-   A distributed event consumer, which uses Azure Blobs for checkpointing and coordination. This is implemented in the [Processor](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-cpp/storage.html).
    The Processor is useful when you want to have the partition assignment be dynamically chosen, and balanced with other Processor instances.

### Open an Event Hubs message producer on an Event Hub instance

```rust no_run
use azure_core::Error;
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;
use azure_messaging_eventhubs::ProducerClient;

async fn open_producer_client() -> Result<ProducerClient, Error> {
    let host = "<EVENTHUBS_HOST>";
    let eventhub = "<EVENTHUB_NAME>";

    let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;

    let producer = ProducerClient::builder()
        .open(host, eventhub, credential.clone())
        .await?;

    Ok(producer)
}
```

### Send events

There are two mechanisms used to send events to an Event Hub instance. The first directly
sends individual messages to the Event Hub, the second uses a "batch" operation to
send multiple messages in a single network request to the service.

#### Send events directly to the Event Hub

```rust no_run
use azure_core::Error;
use azure_messaging_eventhubs::ProducerClient;

async fn send_events(producer: &ProducerClient) -> Result<(), Error> {
    producer.send_event(vec![1, 2, 3, 4], None).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

#### Send events using a batch operation

```rust no_run
use azure_core::Error;
use azure_messaging_eventhubs::ProducerClient;

async fn send_events(producer: &ProducerClient) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let batch = producer.create_batch(None).await?;
    assert_eq!(batch.len(), 0);
    assert!(batch.try_add_event_data(vec![1, 2, 3, 4], None)?);

    let res = producer.send_batch(batch, None).await;
    assert!(res.is_ok());

    Ok(())
}
```

### Open an Event Hubs message consumer on an Event Hub instance

```rust no_run
use azure_core::Error;
use azure_identity::DeveloperToolsCredential;
use azure_messaging_eventhubs::ConsumerClient;

async fn open_consumer_client() -> Result<ConsumerClient, Error> {
    let host = "<EVENTHUBS_HOST>".to_string();
    let eventhub = "<EVENTHUB_NAME>".to_string();

    let credential = DeveloperToolsCredential::new(None)?;

    let consumer = azure_messaging_eventhubs::ConsumerClient::builder()
        .open(&host, eventhub, credential.clone())
        .await?;

    Ok(consumer)
}
```

### Receive events

The following example shows how to receive events from partition 0 on an Event Hubs instance.

It assumes that the caller has provided a consumer client which will be used to receive
events.

Each message receiver can only receive messages from a single Event Hubs partition

```rust no_run
use futures::stream::StreamExt;
use azure_core::Error;
use azure_messaging_eventhubs::{
    ConsumerClient, OpenReceiverOptions, StartLocation, StartPosition,
};

// By default, an event receiver only receives new events from the event hub. To receive events from earlier, specify
// a `start_position` which represents the position from which to start receiving events.
// In this example, events are received from the start of the partition.
async fn receive_events(client: &ConsumerClient) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let message_receiver = client
        .open_receiver_on_partition(
            "0".to_string(),
            Some(OpenReceiverOptions {
                start_position: Some(StartPosition {
                    location: StartLocation::Earliest,
                    ..Default::default()
                }),
                ..Default::default()
            }),
        )
        .await?;

    let mut event_stream = message_receiver.stream_events();

    while let Some(event_result) = event_stream.next().await {
        match event_result {
            Ok(event) => {
                // Process the received event
                println!("Received event: {:?}", event);
            }
            Err(err) => {
                // Handle the error
                eprintln!("Error receiving event: {:?}", err);
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

When you interact with the Azure Event Hubs client library using the Rust SDK, errors returned by the service are returned as `azure_core::Error` values using `ErrorKind::Other` which are `azure_messaging_eventhubs::Error` values.

### Logging

The Event Hubs SDK client uses the [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) package to
enable diagnostics.
