# Cargo audit configuration
#
# This file configures cargo-audit to fail on critical severity vulnerabilities.
#
# Severity Threshold Behavior:
# ==============================
# The `severity_threshold` option determines the minimum CVSS severity level
# required for cargo-audit to fail (exit code 1). Available levels:
# - "none": Reports all advisories but doesn't fail on any severity
# - "low": Fails on low, medium, high, and critical severity issues
# - "medium": Fails on medium, high, and critical severity issues  
# - "high": Fails on high and critical severity issues
# - "critical": Only fails on critical severity issues (strictest for failures)
#
# Behavior in Various Scenarios:
# - If a vulnerability with severity >= threshold is found: exit code 1 (failure)
# - If only vulnerabilities below threshold are found: exit code 0 (success, but warnings shown)
# - If no vulnerabilities are found: exit code 0 (success)
# - If there's an error (e.g., can't fetch advisory DB): exit code 2
#
# With this configuration set to "critical", cargo-audit will:
# - FAIL (exit 1): When critical severity vulnerabilities are detected
# - PASS (exit 0): When only high, medium, low, or no vulnerabilities are found
#   (though lower severity issues will still be reported as warnings)
