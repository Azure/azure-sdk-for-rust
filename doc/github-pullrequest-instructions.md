# Instructions for GitHub Pull Requests

- GitHub Pull Requests should follow the standard form for Git commits:

  ```markdown
  title of no more than 50 characters

  multi-line descriptions
  ```

- Summarize changes for a title of no more than 50 characters ideally, with a hard stop at 80 characters.
- Descriptions can be multiple lines or even paragraphs using markdown.
- Descriptions may contain markdown.
- Descriptions should not repeat a lot of content already found in the changed files.
- Summarize changes for each file if no more than 10 files are changed.
- If multiple files contain the same changes, group them together when summarizing changes.
- Try to reason why changes were made and not about what was changed.
- If any added comments in changed files reference fixing an issue like "Fixes #1234" include that same text in the description.
- If multiple issues are fixed or resolved, include that same text separately for each issue like "Fixes #1234 and fixes #5678".
