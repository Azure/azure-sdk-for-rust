# Azure Service Crates

Rust crates for accessing [Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/). These crates are client libraries generated by [AutoRust](autorust) using the web service [specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification) found in Azure/azure-rest-api-specs. The specifications are divided into two categories - [control plane and data plane](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane). "You use the control plane to manage resources in your subscription. You use the data plane to use capabilities exposed by your instance of a resource type."

There are 168 specifications. So far, we have generated 100 control plane crates. We expect that number to go up as AutoRust matures and bugs are fixed.

## Control Plane Crates
The control plane crates are named `azure_mgmt_${specification_directory}`, such as `azure_mgmt_storage`. Each service may have multiple API versions. Each API version has a set of OpenAPI 2.0 documents, listed under a `Tag` in a [readme.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/storage/resource-manager/readme.md) file in a `Configuration` section. Sometimes there are multiple `Tag`s for the same API version. For example, [Tag: package-2018-07](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/storage/resource-manager/readme.md#tag-package-2018-07) and [Tag: package-2018-07-only](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/storage/resource-manager/readme.md#tag-package-2018-07-only). Rust code is generated for each tag and organized as a crate feature. The first tag without `-preview` is selected as the default feature:

``` toml
[features]
default = ["package-2019-06"]
"package-2020-08-preview" = []
"package-2019-06" = []
"package-2019-04" = []
"package-2018-11" = []
"package-2018-07" = []
"package-2018-07-only" = []
"package-2018-03" = []
"package-2018-02" = []
"package-2017-10" = []
"package-2017-06" = []
"package-2016-12" = []
"package-2016-05" = []
"package-2016-01" = []
"package-2015-06" = []
"package-2015-05-preview" = []
```

The default feature will be used when this dependency is specified:
``` toml
[dependencies]
azure_mgmt_storage = { git = "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust" }
```

To use another tag, for example to try out the newer preview API, you must disable the default:
``` toml
[dependencies]
azure_mgmt_storage = { git = "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust", default-features = false, features = ["package-2020-08-preview"] }
```

A few use cases require using more than tag. This can be done by [renaming the dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#renaming-dependencies-in-cargotoml):
``` toml
[dependencies]
azure_mgmt_storage_2019_06 = { package = "azure_mgmt_storage", git = "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust", default-features = false, features = ["package-2019-06"] }
azure_mgmt_storage_2018_02 = { package = "azure_mgmt_storage", git = "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust", default-features = false, features = ["package-2018-02"] }
```

## Data Plane Crates
The data plane crates will be named `azure_svc_${specification_directory}`, such as `azure_svc_storage`.

## Examples
There are a few examples:
- [mgmt/storage/examples/storage_account_list.rs](mgmt/storage/examples/storage_account_list.rs)
- [mgmt/resources/examples/group_create.rs](mgmt/resources/examples/group_create.rs)
- [mgmt/compute/examples/vm_list.rs](mgmt/compute/examples/vm_list.rs)
- [mgmt/vmware/examples/vmware_private_cloud_list.rs](mgmt/vmware/examples/vmware_private_cloud_list.rs)
