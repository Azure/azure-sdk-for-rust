# Azure Service Crates

Rust crates for accessing [Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/). These crates are client libraries generated by [AutoRust](autorust) using the web service [specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification). The specifications are divided into two categories - [control plane and data plane](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane). "You use the control plane to manage resources in your subscription. You use the data plane to use capabilities exposed by your instance of a resource type."

When this document was last updated, there were 185 [control plane crates](mgmt) and 29 [data plane crates](svc).

## Control Plane Crates
The control plane crates are named `azure_mgmt_${servicename}`, such as `azure_mgmt_storage`.

## Data Plane Crates
The data plane crates will be named `azure_svc_${servicename}`, such as `azure_svc_storage`.

## Examples
There are a few examples:
- azure_mgmt_storage
    - [storage_account_list](mgmt/storage/examples/storage_account_list.rs)
- azure_mgmt_resources
    - [group_create](mgmt/resources/examples/group_create.rs)
- azure_mgmt_compute
    - [vm_list](mgmt/compute/examples/vm_list.rs)
- azure_mgmt_vmware
    - [private_cloud_list](mgmt/vmware/examples/private_cloud_list.rs)
- azure_svc_batch
    - [list_pools](svc/batch/examples/list_pools.rs)

These services are in their own [Rust workspace](Cargo.toml), so you need to change to the `services` directory to run these examples.
``` sh
cd azure-sdk-for-rust/services
cargo run --package azure_mgmt_storage --example storage_account_list
```

## Dependencies
These creates depend on `azure_core` and `azure_identity`. They are not yet published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/). See the [milestones](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/milestones) to see what is left before that happens. Here is an example of adding `azure_svc_batch` as a dependency.

``` toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["macros"] }
azure_core = { git = "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust" }
azure_identity = { git = "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust" }
azure_svc_batch = { git = "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust" }
```

Each crate may support several [API versions](api-versions.md).
