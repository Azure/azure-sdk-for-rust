## Getting Started

To get started with a crate, see the README.md file located in the crate's project folder.  You can find these crate folders grouped by service in the `/sdk` directory.

## Crates available

Each service can have both 'client' and 'management' crates. 'Client' crates are used to consume the service, whereas 'management' crates are used to configure and manage the service.

[All Azure SDK for Rust crates](https://crates.io/teams/github:azure:azure-sdk-publish-rust) are published on crates.io.

### Client modules

Our client crates follow the [Azure Rust SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/rust_introduction.html). These crates allow you to use, consume, and interact with existing resources, for example, uploading a blob. They also share a number of core functionalities including retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. that can be found in the [azure_identity](https://crates.io/crates/azure_identity) module.

You can find the most up-to-date list of new modules on our [latest page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#rust).

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-beta modules.

### Services
Azure service crates generated from [Azure REST API Specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) are available in [services](services).

## Status

ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨: This project is under active development. Be aware that large breaking changes will happen before 1.0 is reached.

### Historical releases

This project is the successor to the `azure_sdk*` crates from [MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust). The crates have been renamed, so those older crates should be considered fully deprecated. See [history](HISTORY.md) for more details.
