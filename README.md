# Azure SDK for Rust

[![Take Our Design Discussion Survey](https://img.shields.io/badge/Take%20Our%20Design%20Discussion%20Survey-008000?style=flat&link=https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/repo-badge)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/repo-badge)

This repository is for the active development of the Azure SDK for Rust.

## Crates ðŸ“¦

[All Azure SDK for Rust crates](https://crates.io/users/azure-sdk) are published on crates.io.

## Getting started

To get started with a library, see the `README.md` file located in the library's project folder. You can find these library project folders grouped by service in the `/sdk` directory.

For full file code examples, check out the `/examples` directory in any library project folder.

### Installing crates

Use `cargo` to install crates from the Azure SDK for Rust.

```sh
cargo add azure_identity azure_security_keyvault_secrets tokio
```

## Status

ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨: This project is under active development. Be aware that large breaking changes may happen before 1.0 is reached.

This project is the successor to the `azure_sdk*` crates from [MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust). The crates have been renamed, so those older crates should be considered fully deprecated.

## Project Structure

Each supported Azure service is its own separate crate.

Building each crate should be as straight forward as `cargo build`, but check each crate's README for more specific information.

## Need help?

- For examples, go to the `examples` subdirectory in any library's project folder e.g., `/sdk/identity/azure_identity/examples`
- Have a question, or find a bug? File an issue via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues/new/choose).
- Check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+rust) or ask new ones on StackOverflow using the `azure` and `rust` tags.

## Data Collection

The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described below. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and Microsoftâ€™s [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704). For more information on the data collected by the Azure SDK, please visit the [Telemetry Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy) page.

### Telemetry Configuration

A `User-Agent` header is sent in requests by default with a value similar to:

> azsdk-rust-security_keyvault_secrets/0.4.0 (1.86.0; linux; aarch64)

You can assign an optional application ID for your own telemetry by setting `UserAgentOptions::application_id`. This will appear at the beginning of the `User-Agent` header.

To disable sending the `User-Agent` header entirely, you can write a `Policy` that will remove it:

```rust no_run
use async_trait::async_trait;
use azure_core::http::{
    policies::{Policy, PolicyResult},
    Context, Request,
};
use std::sync::Arc;

// Define a policy that will remove the User-Agent header.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct RemoveUserAgent;

#[async_trait]
impl Policy for RemoveUserAgent {
    async fn send(
        &self,
        ctx: &Context,
        request: &mut Request,
        next: &[Arc<dyn Policy>],
    ) -> PolicyResult {
        let headers = request.headers_mut();

        // Note: HTTP headers are case-insensitive but client-added headers are normalized to lowercase.
        headers.remove("user-agent");

        next[0].send(ctx, request, &next[1..]).await
    }
}
```

For a complete example, see our [`azure_core` example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/blob/main/sdk/core/azure_core/examples/core_remove_user_agent.rs).

### Reporting security issues and security bugs

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) <secure@microsoft.com>. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue).
