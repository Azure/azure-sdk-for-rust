# Azure SDK for Rust

This repository is for the development of the [unofficial, unsupported](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/blob/legacy/FAQ.md#why-is-it-unofficial) Azure SDK for Rust.

> Microsoft is developing the official Azure SDK for Rust crates and has no plans to update these unofficial crates.
> In the future we may release official versions that may have a different package names.
> If releasing an official version of this crate is important to you [let us know](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues/new/choose).
>
> Source for this crate can now be found in <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/tree/legacy>.
> To monitor for an official, supported version of this crate, see <https://aka.ms/azsdk/releases>.

- [azure_identity](https://crates.io/crates/azure_identity)
- [azure_data_cosmos](https://crates.io/crates/azure_data_cosmos)
- [azure_data_tables](https://crates.io/crates/azure_data_tables)
- [azure_iot_hub](https://crates.io/crates/azure_iot_hub)

## Status

ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨: This project is no longer under active development. Work on officially supported crates is being done in the `main` branch. Pull requests to `legacy` may be considered but are not guaranteed to be merged. Instead, you might consider forking this repository, creating a topic branch you'd need to submit a pull request anyway, and [override dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) in your `Cargo.toml` file(s) as necessary.

This project is the successor to the `azure_sdk*` crates from [MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust). The crates have been renamed, so those older crates should be considered fully deprecated. See [history](HISTORY.md) for more details.

## Project Structure

Each supported Azure service is its own separate crate.

Building each crate should be as straight forward as `cargo build`, but check each crate's README for more specific information.

### Mock testing framework

This library comes with a testing framework that executes against prerecorded sessions to quickly validate code changes without incurring in Azure costs. You can read more about it in the [Mock testing framework's README](docs/mock_transport.md).
