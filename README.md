# Azure SDK for Rust

This repository is for the active development of the Azure SDK for Rust. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/) and looking up the docs for any of libraries in the SDK.

## Getting started

To get started with a library, see the `README.md` file located in the library's project folder. You can find these library project folders grouped by service in the `/sdk` directory.

For full file code examples, check out the `/examples` directory in any library project folder.

## Crates

[All Azure SDK for Rust crates](https://crates.io/teams/github:azure:azure-sdk-publish-rust) are published on crates.io.

## Status

ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨: This project is under active development. Be aware that large breaking changes may happen before 1.0 is reached.

This project is the successor to the `azure_sdk*` crates from [MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust). The crates have been renamed, so those older crates should be considered fully deprecated. See [history](HISTORY.md) for more details.

## Project Structure

Each supported Azure service is its own separate crate.

Building each crate should be as straight forward as `cargo build`, but check each crate's README for more specific information.

### Mock testing framework

This library comes with a testing framework that executes against prerecorded sessions to quickly validate code changes without incurring in Azure costs. You can read more about it in the [Mock testing framework's README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/tree/feature/track2/doc/mock_transport.md).

## Need help?

- For reference documentation visit [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/).
- For examples, go to the `/examples` sub-directory in any library's project folder.
  - Ex:`/sdk/identity/azure_identity/examples`
- Have a question, or find a bug? File an issue via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues/new/choose).
- Check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+rust) or ask new ones on StackOverflow using the `azure` and `rust` tags.
