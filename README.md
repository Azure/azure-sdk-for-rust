# Azure SDK for Rust

This repository is for the development of the [unofficial](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/blob/main/FAQ.md#why-is-it-unofficial) Azure SDK for Rust.

## Crates

[All Azure SDK for Rust crates](https://crates.io/teams/github:azure:azure-sdk-publish-rust) are published on crates.io.

### SDK
These [SDK crates](sdk) are available:
- [azure_core](https://crates.io/crates/azure_core)
- [azure_identity](https://crates.io/crates/azure_identity)
- [azure_data_cosmos](https://crates.io/crates/azure_data_cosmos)
- [azure_data_tables](https://crates.io/crates/azure_data_tables)
- [azure_iot_hub](https://crates.io/crates/azure_iot_hub)
- [azure_security_keyvault](https://crates.io/crates/azure_security_keyvault)
- [azure_storage_blobs](https://crates.io/crates/azure_storage_blobs)
- [azure_storage_datalake](https://crates.io/crates/azure_storage_datalake)
- [azure_storage_queues](https://crates.io/crates/azure_storage_queues)

### Services
Azure service crates generated from [Azure REST API Specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) are available in [services](services).

## Status

ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨: This project is under active development. Be aware that large breaking changes will happen before 1.0 is reached.

This project is the successor to the `azure_sdk*` crates from [MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust). The crates have been renamed, so those older crates should be considered fully deprecated. See [history](HISTORY.md) for more details.

## Project Structure

Each supported Azure service is its own separate crate.

Building each crate should be as straight forward as `cargo build`, but check each crate's README for more specific information.

### Mock testing framework

This library comes with a testing framework that executes against prerecorded sessions to quickly validate code changes without incurring in Azure costs. You can read more about it in the [Mock testing framework's README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/tree/feature/track2/doc/mock_transport.md).
