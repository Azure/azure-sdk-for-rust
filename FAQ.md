# Frequently Asked Questions

## When will the crates be published to crates.io?

We want them to be published soon too! [Milestones](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/milestones) have been created to help figure out issues remaining.

## How do we build a case for making it official?

We need to show customer usage and demand. We can collect usage statics from [User-Agent telemetry](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy), crate downloads, and GitHub activity like GitHub stars. Customer testimonials would also be helpful.
