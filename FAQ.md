# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why is it unofficial?

This is an *unofficial* Azure SDK because it is not yet supported by Azure Support or the Azure SDK team. It has been built primarily by volunteers on their own time. For more information, see the [project history](HISTORY.md).

## How do we build a case for making it official?

We need to show customer usage and demand. We can collect usage statics from [User-Agent telemetry](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy), crate downloads, and GitHub activity like GitHub stars. Customer testimonials would also be helpful.
