## About this Crate

[Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) is a service in Microsoft Azure for securely storing and accessing secrets, credentials and certificates in the cloud.
This crate exposes Rust bindings for the Azure Key Vault [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/).

This was started as a standalone contribution to [MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust),
which has many other useful Azure REST API bindings for Rust.

## Important Disclaimer

I am a Microsoft employee, but this is not an official Microsoft product nor an endorsed product.
Purely a project for fun and for learning Rust.

## Example Usage

```rust
use azure_sdk_keyvault::KeyVaultClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut client = KeyVaultClient::new(&"c1a6d79b-082b-4798-b362-a77e96de50db", &"SUPER_SECRET_KEY", &"bc598e67-03d8-44d5-aa46-8289b9a39a14", &"test-keyvault");

    // Set a secret.
    client.set_secret("test-secret", "42").await?;

    // Get a secret.
    let secret = client.get_secret("test-secret").await?;
    assert_eq!("42", secret.value());

    Ok(())
}
```
